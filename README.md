# Covid-Data-Analysis
Dive deep into the census and covid data for Texas
# Business Understanding [10]  
What is COVID-19 and what is social distancing and flattening the curve? Why is it important to 
look at data about the virus spread, hospitalizations, and available resources? Who is interested 
in this information? What decisions can be informed using such data? [10 point]  

# Data Understanding [45]  
* What data is available? Describe the type of data (scale, values, etc.) of the most 
important variables in the data. [9 point]  
* Verify data quality: Are there missing values? Duplicate Data? Outliers? Are those 
mistakes? How can these be fixed? [9 Points]  
* Give simple appropriate statistics (range, mode, mean, median, variance, etc.) for the 
most important variables in these files and describe what they mean or if you find 
something interesting. [9 points]  
* Visualize the most important attributes appropriately. Provide an interpretation for 
each graph. Explain for each attribute type why you chose the visualization. [9 points]  
* Explore relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes and then use cross-
tabulation, correlation, group-wise averages and box plots, etc. as appropriate. [9 
points]

# Data Preparation [35]  
* Create a data set with objects as rows and features as columns. Use as objects counties 
in the US. [20 points] 
Interesting features may be for example:  
  * When was the first case reported? 
  * How fast did the virus spread? 
  * How (densely) populated is the county? 
  * What resources (money, hospital)? 
  * What is the social distancing response and how long did it take after the first case?  
* Visualize the created attributes. [15 points] 

# Exceptional Work [10 points] 
Examples: Ask your own questions and answer them, insightful visualization of results, 
in-depth explanation why one method works better than another, developing special 
preprocessing, and using and explaining a method not covered in class.
